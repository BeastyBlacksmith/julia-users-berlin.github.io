      Hi all, we started a basic Julia get together in 2015. It was nice to get to meet some of the other Julia users here in Berlin.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Following the recent <a href=http://pydata.org/berlin2016/>PyData</a> conference in Berlin a lot of interest was expressed
      in meeting more regularly to discuss Julia related topics. I have set up this GitHub webpage in order to aid with co-ordination
      and so that there will be a landing page when people search for Julia in Berlin.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The discussion organising the first meetup is on the Julia Users google groups forum <a href=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/julia-users/berlin/julia-users/dhOpyGm11xY/33HTBdvmAusJ>here</a>
    </p>

       Announcement:
      </b> our next meet-up will take place at St. Oberholz on Thursday June 9th at 7pm.
