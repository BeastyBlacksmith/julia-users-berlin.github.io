      Hi all, we started a basic Julia get together in 2015. It was nice to get to meet some of the other Julia users here in Berlin.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Following the recent <a href=http://pydata.org/berlin2016/>PyData</a> conference in Berlin a lot of interest was expressed
      in meeting more regularly to discuss Julia related topics. I have set up this GitHub webpage in order to aid with co-ordination
      and so that there will be a landing page when people search for Julia in Berlin.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The discussion organising the first meetup is on the Julia Users google groups forum <a href=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/julia-users/berlin/julia-users/dhOpyGm11xY/33HTBdvmAusJ>here</a>
    </p>

      <b>
       Announcement:
      </b> our next meet-up will take place at <a href=https://www.google.de/maps/place/St.+Oberholz/@52.529518,13.3996792,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47a851e4644a4b75:0xf49417256487121c!8m2!3d52.5295371!4d13.4018638?hl=en>St. Oberholz</a>
      on <b>Thursday June 9th</b> at <b>7pm</b>. Visiting will be <a href=http://www.mit.edu/~mlubin/>Miles Lubin</a> who co-wrote the <a href=https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl>JuMP</a>
      library and helped to setup <a href=https://github.com/JuliaOpt>JuliaOpt</a> as a centre for high-quality optimisation using Julia.
      </br>
      The main topics of the night will be (i) Julia [I'm guessing focussing on Optimisation techniques this week] and (ii) the basic format of the users group meet-ups.
      </br>
      Please come along if you're interested in having future Julia meet-up events in Berlin. We need to gauge the level of interest. You can
      follow any organisational changes in this thread on <a href=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/julia-users/S3eMY64c_dE>google groups</a>.
