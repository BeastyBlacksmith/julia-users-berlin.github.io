      <h3>History</h3>
      <p> Julia Users Group - Berlin had its first get together in 2015. The discussion organising the first meetup can be found on the <a href=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/julia-users/berlin/julia-users/dhOpyGm11xY/33HTBdvmAusJ>Julia Users Google group forum</a>.</p>
      <p>Following the 2016 <a href=http://pydata.org/berlin2016/>PyData</a> conference in Berlin a lot of interest was expressed in meeting more regularly to discuss Julia-related topics. Since then we've been trying to co-ordinate a bi-monthly meet-up of Julia users in Berlin.

                <b>Topic:</b> Hector spoke about using Julia for mathematical applications, in a talk entitled <em>Filter-based implementation of Fast Wavelet and Shearlet transform in Julia</em>. We also briefly discussed our plans for hosting an Introduction to Julia workshop aimed at numerically literate users. And we had an informal overview discussion of parallelisation using Julia.</br>

Visiting will be <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~mlubin/">Miles Lubin</a> who co-wrote the <a href="https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl">JuMP</a> library and helped to setup <a href="https://github.com/JuliaOpt">JuliaOpt</a> as a centre for high-quality optimisation using Julia. The main topics of the night will be (i) Julia [I'm guessing focussing on Optimisation techniques this week] and (ii) the basic format of the users group meet-ups.</p><p>Please come along if you're interested in having future Julia meet-up events in Berlin. We need to gauge the level of interest. You can follow any organisational changes in this thread on <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/julia-users/S3eMY64c_dE">google groups</a></p>
